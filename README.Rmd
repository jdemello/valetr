# valetr

The `valetr` package provides an R-native interface to [Bank of Canada's Valet API](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/docs) &mdash;read [terms and condtions](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/terms/). Some of the data available include key monetary policy variables &mdash;Total CPI and M aggregates.

Valet also provides a route to Foreign Exchange Rates in RSS. This route returns the **most recent** foreign exchange rate &mdash;one observation only. Therefore, it has little application for this package.

## Installation

`valetr` has yet to be submitted to CRAN.
